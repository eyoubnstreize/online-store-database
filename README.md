# Online Store Database

This repository contains the SQL schema, sample data, and queries for an online store database project.

## Files

- **schema.sql** â†’ Database schema (tables and relationships)
- **data.sql** â†’ Sample data insertion

## Database Schema

The schema models an online store with:
- Clients and their delivery addresses
- Products organized by categories
- Orders with line items
- Payments and deliveries

## How to Use

1. Create the database (PostgreSQL recommended).
2. Run `schema.sql` to create the tables.
3. Run `data.sql` to insert sample data.
4. Run `queries.sql` to test with example queries.

## Example Queries

- List all clients
- Show orders with client names and status
- Find products ordered by a specific client
- Calculate total spent by each client
- Check for late deliveries
